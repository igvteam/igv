  description: |
    This command toggles the display of amino acid translations in the sequence track.
    When enabled, IGV shows the 3-frame translation of the DNA sequence, displaying the
    amino acids that would be produced in each reading frame. This is useful for identifying
    open reading frames, verifying coding sequences, and analyzing the impact of variants
    on protein sequence.

    This command specifies the directory path where IGV will save images created with
    the snapshot command. This must be set before taking snapshots if you want them
    saved to a specific location. If not set, IGV uses a default location which may
    vary by platform.
  arguments:
    - name: directoryPath
      description: The path to the directory where snapshots will be saved.
