- name: new
  description: |
    This command resets IGV to a clean state by unloading all data tracks, similar to
    starting IGV fresh. The default genome annotations (genes, etc.) are retained, but
    all user-loaded tracks are removed. This is useful
    for starting a new analysis or clearing out old data before loading new files.
    
    Use this tool when you need to:
    - Start a fresh analysis without restarting IGV
    - Clear all loaded data tracks to free memory
    - Reset the view before loading a new set of files
    - Clean up between batch processing jobs
    - Remove all tracks while keeping the same reference genome


- name: saveSession
  description: |
    This command saves all aspects of the current IGV session including loaded tracks, their display settings, the 
    current genome, and visible region.  The session file (XML format) can be loaded later to restore the exact state.
    
    Use this tool when you need to:
    - Save your work for later continuation
    - Create reproducible analysis configurations
    - Share IGV setups with collaborators
    - Document the exact state of an analysis for publications
    - Create template sessions for batch processing
    - Backup current work before making major changes

    Note: Session files contain paths to data files, not the data itself. Ensure
    data files remain accessible at their original locations when loading the session.

  arguments:
    - name: filename
      description: |
        The path where the session file should be saved. It is strongly recommended to use a full absolute path. 
        The file will be saved in XML format with a .xml extension (add .xml if not included).
        
        Example: "/full/path/to/my_session.xml"

- name: genome
  description: |
    
    Loads a genome by its identifier or path.

    - Switch between different species' genomes
    - Prepare IGV for loading data aligned to a specific genome build
    - Load genomes from local files or remote URLs
    
    Note: Loading a new genome will unload all currently loaded data tracks.

  arguments:
    - name: idOrPath
      description: |
        The identifier (ID) of the genome to load, or a path.  In most cases the id is the UCSC name (e.g., hg19, hg38, mm10).
        Custom genomes can also be loaded by ID they have been added to the IGV genome list.  Alterrnatively, a genome 
        can be specified as local file path or URL to a genome json file, and indexed fasta file, or a two-bit file.


        Common genome IDs: hg38, hg19, mm10, mm39, rn6, danRer11, dm6, ce11, sacCer3

    Captures a snapshot image of the current IGV view.
    
    This command saves the current IGV view as an image file. You can specify a filename or let
    IGV generate one automatically based on the current locus. The file format is
    determined by the filename extension (.png or .svg).  
    
    Note: Set snapshot_directory first to control where images are saved. Set
    max_panel_height to control how much vertical space is captured. The view should
    be fully rendered before taking a snapshot (consider using set_sleep_interval).

  arguments:

    vary by platform.
  arguments:
    - name: directoryPath
      description: The path to the directory where snapshots will be saved.

- name: maxPanelHeight
  description: |
    This command sets the maximum height (in pixels) for each track panel when
    capturing snapshots in IGV. This helps control the vertical size of the
    resulting image, especially when many tracks are loaded.
    
    Use this tool when you need to:

- name: setSequenceStrand
  description: |
    Sets which DNA strand to display in the sequence track.

    This command controls whether the positive (forward) or negative (reverse) strand
    sequence is displayed in IGV's sequence track. This affects the nucleotide sequence
    shown and, if enabled, the 3-frame translation. Note that this changes which strand's
    sequence is shown but does not reverse the left-to-right direction of the display.
    
    Use this tool when you need to:
      - View the sequence of genes on the negative strand
      - Verify reverse complement sequences for primers or probes
    
    Note: This changes which strand's sequence is displayed but maintains the left-to-right
    genomic coordinate direction. The negative strand will show the reverse complement.

  arguments:
    - name: strand
      description: The strand to set for the sequence track.
      enumValues:
        - value: "+"
          description: Positive strand

- name: setSequenceShowTranslation
  description: |
    This command enables the display of amino acid translations in the sequence track.
    When enabled, IGV shows the 3-frame translation of the DNA sequence, displaying the
    amino acids that would be produced in each reading frame. This is useful for identifying
    open reading frames, verifying coding sequences, and analyzing the impact of variants
    on protein sequence.
    
    Use this tool when you need to:
    - Identify open reading frames (ORFs) in genomic sequence
    - Analyze the effect of variants on amino acid sequence
    - Find potential start and stop codons
    - Examine frameshift mutations and their consequences
    - Validate gene annotations by checking translation

    Note: The translation shown depends on the current strand setting (set with
    set_sequence_strand). You must be zoomed in sufficiently to see sequence details.

  arguments:
    - name: showTranslation
      description: Whether to show the 3-frame translation in the sequence track.
      enumValues:
        - value: "True"
